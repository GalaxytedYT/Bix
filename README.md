Keep reading to understand how to use it.

Now, make a new folder on the root of your C: Drive (or any other drive you wanna run Bix on.), and name it "Bix" (These steps are needed because the code has to be edited in order to match your directory, If you don't want to put it on the root of your C: Drive (again, or any other drive), You can edit the code.)

For the installation, this is pretty much it. Now, I'll be givin' up a little help.
Start up bix.bat (If you think it's a virus, right click it and click edit, then look through the code, If you still think it's a virus, then just don't use it, I ain't forcing ya)
For any command that needs input type in the command. (NOTE: If the design isn't the same, you might be in the future, This is only updated when it's needed to.)

You have to first type the command, hit enter, then it will show only the dollar sign ("$"), there is where your input goes, so type in, hit enter. and that's it.
For now, this is what you need to know. (I added a profile to the new Windows Terminal, here's the code for the profile

                "guid": "{48a23f44-e413-4257-87a6-5b6ee4500003}",
                "name": "bix",
                "commandline": "C:\\Bix\\BIX\\bix.bat",
                "icon": "C:\\Bix\\icon.bmp",
                "cursorShape": "filledBox",
                "hidden": false
                
)
